This project is a launcher for minecraft for Ubuntu.

Place mincraft.desktop in /usr/share/applications
Place minecraft.sh somewhere in your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and rename it to minecraft
You will need to create an icon, and save it as /usr/share/pixmaps/minecraft.png I use favicon.png for this (found in the minecraft.jar launcher that you can download from https://minecraft.net/download )
You will also need to download that launcher and place it in /usr/local/bin
